## Here are the interactions and instructions for compiling and executing the program: 

## When you run the program:

-- It will silently perform its calculations without any prompts or user -- input.
-- It will print the modified array to the console.
-- The output will be: 2 4 6 8 10

## nstructions to compile and execute:

## 1. Save the code:

-- Save the code in a file named modify_array.c (or any preferred name with a .c extension).

## 2. Open a terminal or command prompt:

-- Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

## Compile the code:

-- Use a C compiler like GCC to compile the code
gcc modify_array.c -o modify_array
This will create an executable file named modify_array.

-- install GCC compailer for C code 

-- Execute the compiled program:
./modify_array
This will run the program and print the output to the console.
