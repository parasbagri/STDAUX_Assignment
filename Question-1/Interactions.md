## Prerequisites:

## Database Management System (DBMS):
- You'll need a DBMS installed (e.g., MySQL PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle).

- Database Client: You'll need a tool to interact with the database (e.g., command-line interface, GUI client, programming language).

## General Steps:

## 1.Connect to the database:
 - Use the appropriate command or interface provided by your database client to establish a connection to the database where the "Trans" table resides.

## 2. Open a query editor:
- Access the area where you can type and execute SQL queries in your database client.

## 3. Copy and paste the queries:
- Paste each query from the provided responses into the query editor.

## 4. Execute the queries:
- Run each query individually.

## 5. View the results:
The database system will display the results of each query, typically as a table with columns and rows representing the retrieved data.
