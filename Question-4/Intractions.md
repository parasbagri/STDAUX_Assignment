## Key Points:

- Uses socket programming for network communication.

- Handles basic HTTP GET requests.

- Parses GET parameters for basic dynamic content.

- Sends an HTML response with the parsed parameters.

-Can be expanded with more request handling and response generation.


## Compilation and Execution:

- Save the code as webserver.c.
- Compile with: gcc webserver.c -o webserver
- Run: ./webserver
- Access in a web browser: http://localhost:8080 (or http://localhost:8080?param1=value1&param2=value2 to test parameters) 

## When a web browser accesses the server:

- The server will print the received HTTP request to the terminal.

- It will parse any GET parameters from the request.

- It will construct a simple HTML response, including any parsed parameters.

- It will send the response back to the web browser.

-The web browser will display the response, showing "Hello from the simple web server!" and any parsed parameters. 

## Compilation and Execution:

## Save the code:
- Save the code in a file named webserver.c (or any preferred name with a .c extension).

## Open a terminal or command prompt:
-Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

## Compile the code:
Use a C compiler like GCC to compile the code:

## Bash
gcc webserver.c -o webserver
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will create an executable file named webserver.

## Run the program:
Execute the compiled program:
## Bash
./webserver
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will start the web server.
